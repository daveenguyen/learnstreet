Welcome! Here is a Morse Code project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this fun project, you will write the code to translate words and phrases into morse code!  Code it and start sending cryptic messages to your friends and family -- and then have them come back to your project to decrypt it!

Try it out!
